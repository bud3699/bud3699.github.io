        <p class="Me"> Iâ€™m the kind of person whoâ€™s all about good vibes and making people smile. I love it when I can
            help
            someone out or just make their day a little brighter. Lifeâ€™s full of wonders you just need to find them,
            right? So, I always try to look on the brightside of things. So overall i'd say I'm down pretty chill</p>
