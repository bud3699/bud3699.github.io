                <p>Hey, I'm Bud; I'm a programmer, game developer, and engineer. I'd say I am passionate about creating
                    innovative solutions, but I also like to have a bit of fun. I'm a self taught developer with tons of
                    reverse engineering experience with x64dbg, ghidra, and more. I've developed mods for Subnautica,
                    Minecraft (Both Java and bedrock), and Rust. I've also reprogrammed a ton of Unity games assembly C#
                    in order to unlock certain features or modify gameplay. </p>

        <p class="Me"> I'm the kind of person who's all about good vibes and making people smile. I love it when i can
            help someone out or just make their day a little brighter. Life's full of wonder; you just need to find
            them, right ? So, I always try to look on the brightside of things. Overall, I'd say I'm pretty chill.</p>
