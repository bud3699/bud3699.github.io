  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>Welcome to <strong>MorseMaster</strong>. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of this site. By continuing to use MorseMaster, you agree to the following conditions. If you don’t agree with anything stated here, you should stop using the site.</p>

  <h2>1. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>MorseMaster is entirely my creation. I’ve personally designed, coded, and styled everything on this site. That includes the layout, visuals, UI/UX, original features, and the Morse learning mechanics.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You are not allowed to copy or reuse any part of the code, whether frontend, backend logic, or design patterns.</li>
    <li>You may not replicate MorseMaster under a different name or claim its ideas or functionality as your own.</li>
    <li>Redistribution, modification, or monetization of any part of MorseMaster without my written permission is strictly prohibited.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Local Use Only</h2>
  <p>MorseMaster operates entirely on your device. There are no accounts, no sign-ins, no back-end servers, and no cloud storage.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All of your activity, including profile name and progress, is stored using your browser’s local storage.</li>
    <li>I do not receive or access any of your data. I never track, log, or analyze your usage.</li>
    <li>If you clear your browser data or use private/incognito mode, your profile data may be lost — I don’t control that.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>This site is meant purely for learning and practicing Morse code in a respectful and safe way.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Don’t attempt to tamper with or reverse engineer the code, logic, or interface.</li>
    <li>Don’t use automation tools, bots, or scripts to misuse or exploit the functionality.</li>
    <li>Don’t repackage MorseMaster as your own product or try to mimic its design and claim originality.</li>
    <li>If you share the site, please give credit where it's due.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. No Warranty</h2>
  <p>MorseMaster is provided "as-is." I’ve put in effort to make it functional and bug-free, but I can’t make promises or offer support guarantees.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If something doesn’t work correctly, I’ll do my best to fix it when I have time — but I can’t guarantee timelines or compatibility across all devices/browsers.</li>
    <li>I don’t promise that MorseMaster will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that it will always meet your expectations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>MorseMaster is a lightweight, local-only web app. Because nothing leaves your device, the risks are incredibly low. That said:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I’m not liable for any unusual behavior caused by rare browser bugs, browser updates, or changes in local storage behavior.</li>
    <li>I’m also not responsible if your progress is lost due to things like clearing your cache or local storage, or using incognito/private mode.</li>
    <li>By using MorseMaster, you accept that you are fully responsible for managing your own browser data and environment.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. External Links</h2>
  <p>In the future, I may link to other Morse resources or educational sites. Those links are there for convenience only.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I don’t control or take responsibility for third-party content, policies, or how those sites handle your data.</li>
    <li>If you choose to follow any external links, do so at your own risk.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>Your privacy is important to me. Currently, I do not collect, store, or share any personal data from users of this site.</p>
  <p>However, I may update my data collection practices in the future. When I do, I will update the <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> accordingly. Please review the Privacy Policy periodically for the latest information on how I handle data.</p>

  <h2>8. Updates and Modifications</h2>
  <p>I might update MorseMaster or change how it works without warning.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Features could be added, modified, or removed based on feedback, technical needs, or just my own plans.</li>
    <li>The site might go offline temporarily for updates, or even permanently, at my discretion.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>This page may be updated from time to time. When I make changes, the "Last updated" date below will reflect that.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you continue using MorseMaster after the terms change, that implies you agree to the new version.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions, feedback, or just want to reach out, you can contact me directly at: <a href="mailto:bud3699@gmail.com">bud3699@gmail.com</a>.</p>
